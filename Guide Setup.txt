Setup

1. Restore the SQL file "hiring_challenge_transactions.sql" to your MySQL database.
2. Once the backup is complete, update the connection strings in the configuration file.In the appsettings.json or appsettings.Development.json file, locate the
    "ConnectionStrings" section and modify the "DefaultConnection" value with your MySQL server, username, password, and database name. 

    "ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "server=Your_server;user=your_user;pwd=your_password;database=hiring_challenge;"
}


3.After updating the connection strings, you can run the API.
4.Once the API is running, you will see two endpoints: 
    a) Login Endpoint: Use this endpoint to obtain an authentication token. The default username and password values have already been set.
    b) Transaction Endpoint: This is the endpoint for retrieving transactions.

5) Start by running the Login API to obtain the authentication token. Use the default username and password provided.
6) After receiving the token, click the "Authorize" button in the Swagger UI. A popup will appear prompting you to enter the bearer token.
7) Once you have successfully authorized, you can start sending requests to the "transaction" API using the provided token.
8) Transaction API

       a) BaseCurrency: Specifies the currency for which we want to retrieve transactions.
	 b) Month: Specifies the month for which we want to retrieve transactions.	
	 c) Year: Specifies the year for which we want to retrieve transactions.
	 d) Page: Specifies the page number of the transaction results to return.
       e) PageSize: Specifies the number of transactions to include per page.

These parameters allow you to customize the query for retrieving transactions based on the desired base currency, month, year, and pagination settings.
